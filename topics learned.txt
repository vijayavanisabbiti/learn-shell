samething happens when we insert with a file
< is used for input

+--------------------+
| Database           |

| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
| transactions       |
+--------------------+

>> is for error / &> is for error and output


Ex: mysql -t -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 <sample &>out
This redirects the input of sample file to error and output to file named out
